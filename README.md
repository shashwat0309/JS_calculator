# JS_calculator
JavaScript calculator to perform basic Mathematical Operations. 
You can easily use it in your local browser.
We used JavaScript, Html and Css for creating this application.It is on basic stage right now as it offers basic operations and evaluates the commands immediately. We'll welcome any feature 
enhancements on it, either more mathematical operations such as conversions between many units of measurement, currency conversion and other trignometric, exponential and logarithmic functions or design functionality which can make it more attractive.
